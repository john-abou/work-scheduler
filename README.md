# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler


## Description
My motivation for making refactoring this webpage was to practice my skills using jQuery and the WebAPI. I furthered my understanding of using functions as I incorporated the use of the WebAPI and jQuery in my functions to update the page as the user took certain actions. Specifically I learned how to better maneuver in the DOM using jQuery, update styling by adding classes or ids usint the WebAPI.

I also will be adding this to my portfolio from assignment 2. I'm looking forward to continue to learn more about server side API's and getting proficient with Boostrap and jQuery.
